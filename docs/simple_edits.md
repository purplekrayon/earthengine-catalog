These are instructions on how to make small changes to the Earth Engine Public
Data Catalog via GitHub. These types of changes might include:

* Correcting typos in text or field names
* Updating a broken URL
* Changing a description of a property or band

Catalog entries are written in [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/),
a JSON templating language that is used to generate
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/) JSON files. You
do not need to know the details of either to make simple changes. Changes are
managed using GitHub. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, refer to the
following resources for guidance.

* [Getting started with GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
* [About branches - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
* [Creating a pull request - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

# Initial setup

1. Fork the Earth Engine Catalog here:
   https://github.com/google/earthengine-catalog/fork
1. Turn on continuous integration (CI) checks by going to your fork's "Actions"
   tab and pressing "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them."
1. In your fork, navigate to the file you would like to edit.

Before we can accept your pull requests you will need to sign a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA):

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you own the
  intellectual property, then you will need to sign an
  [individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
  then you will need to sign a
  [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that,
we will be able to accept your pull requests.

# Make a change

1. Navigate to the file you want to modify. For example,
   `catalog/NOAA/NOAA_GOES_16_FDCC.jsonnet`.
1. Under the pencil menu on the top right of the file, select "Edit in place" or
   press `e`.
1. Make your change.
1. Press "Commit changes..."
1. Edit the "Extended description" to describe the change.
1. Press "Commit changes"
1. Navigate to the top of your fork.
1. Check the validation icon next to the numeric hash (e.g., 'c99f46d')
   for your most recent commit. In case of a problem, follow the instructions
   in the next section.
1. Create a pull request (PR) with your commit(s).

The Earth Engine Data team will be notified of your pull request. It may take
a few days before your change is reviewed. The reviewer may ask you to make
additional changes if there are any issues with the edits. Make an additional
commit to fix any review comments.

Once the pull request has been approved, automated tools will take care of
merging your pull request.

# Watching for checker errors

The status of a commit or pull requests will be next to the commit hash. There
will be a dark red `o` symbol if the continuous integration checks are in
progress. Once they are done, there will be a green check mark for success or
 a red `x` for failure. Click on the `x`.

For checker failures, look at the "Details" section. The "Checker" section will
list any issues that it sees with the changes. Work through the list of issues
from top to bottom editing the file to resolve the issues. Then commit
the changes.

An example issue:

```
Issue('HYCOM/sea_surface_elevation', 'HYCOM/HYCOM_sea_surface_elevation.jsonnet', 'https://github.com/google/earthengine-catalog/blob/main/checker/node/eo_extension.py', 'summaries gsd too small: -123 m', IssueLevel.error)
```

The issue starts with the asset id is followed by the STAC Jsonnet file. The
third entry is URL of the STAC checker module that reported the error. The
fourth entry is the error message. Here it is saying the Ground Sample Distance
is not valid. Click on the URL of the STAC checker to see a detailed description
of the requirements in the docstring comment at the top of the checker.
You can also scroll down to the section with the error text to see the exact
check being run.

For notes about the structure of the file, see the STAC templates here:

# Making additional changes

If you want to have more than one pull request in progress, you will need to
create separate branches.

When coming back for future edits, make sure to select "Update branch" under
"Sync fork" on your "main" branch to get the latest changes from
https://github.com/google/earthengine-catalog. It is okay to discard local edits
if you have no unmerged pull requests on your main branch.
